📡 Semiconductor Manufacturing Defect Detection

📌 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to detect defects in semiconductor manufacturing processes. The dataset contains 592 features and has been preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical data. Various models, including Naïve Bayes classifiers, have been implemented and optimized for better defect classification.

🚀 Features & Highlights

📊 Data Processing & Cleaning:

Handled missing values using imputation techniques.

Applied ordinal encoding for categorical data.

🤖 Machine Learning Models:

Implemented MultinomialNB & CategoricalNB classifiers.

Conducted feature selection, reducing dimensionality while improving model performance.

📈 Performance Metrics:

Achieved F1-score of 43% after optimization.

Improved test accuracy to 26% through feature engineering.

Evaluated models using confusion matrices, precision-recall, and accuracy scores.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning Algorithms: Naïve Bayes, Feature Selection, Model Evaluation Metrics
